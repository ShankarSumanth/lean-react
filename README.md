# lean-react
A lean react starter for absolute beginners. Uses React, Webpack, React Hot reload, Webpack Dev Server, Redux

## Summary

React, with it's vast growing eco-system, tons of packages, too many concepts, ever changing libraries and dependencies, can be overwhelming for beginners.

This starter is my attemp to put all those concepts and explanations at one place, so one does not have to waste time learning them by going through tons of tutorials.
